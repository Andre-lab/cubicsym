# cubicsym
This package provides various tools for using and modelling cubic symmetry with Rosetta. Only the essential functionialities for an end user mind is documented below.

1. Generating cubic symmetry files

## Generating cubic symmetry files

```scripts/cubic_to_rosetta.py``` generates cubic symmetry files of either **Icosahedral**, **Octahedral** or **Tetrahedral symmetry**. The usage of the script is internally well documented. Use 

```python cubic_to_rosetta.py --help```

To see how to use it.
