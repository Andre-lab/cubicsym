# cubicsym
This package provides various tools for using and modelling cubic symmetry with Rosetta. Only the essential functionialities for an enduser is documented below

## Generating cubic symmetry files

```scripts/cubic_to_rosetta.py``` generates cubic symmetry files of either **Icosahedral**, **Octahedral** or **Tetrahedral symmetry**. The usage of the script is internally well documented. Use 

```python cubic_to_rosetta.py --help```

To see how to use it.
